# SeriouslyWhenIsHL3

---

This is the evolution of the original /u/WhenIsHl3 which had a strong following before it's shadowbanning in 2016. SeriouslyWhenIsHL3 intends to correct some of the mistakes from the original bot, including allowing users and moderators to stop the bot commenting on their content if they wish. 

The bot is also created to allow for easily adapting it to other situations, through changing the config and message, along with removing code that wouldn't apply to other projects.

For moderators - To stop the bot commenting on your sub, message the bot `!STOP@subName` where subName is the name of you sub. For example /r/WhenIsHl3 would be `!STOP@WhenIsHl3`. Though it will work with `!STOP@/r/WhenIsHl3` too, as too many people couldn't read instructions...

For users - To stop the bot commenting on your replies, message it `!STOP`.
